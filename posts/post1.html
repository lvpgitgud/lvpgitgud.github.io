          <h2 class="post-title">The colors of our lives through the lens of Ray Bradbury's <i>Kaleidoscope</i></h2>

          <p>Often am I fascinated by how vastly different lives does each of us lead. Yet, I'm fascinated still by the similiarity they all seem to shared.
            Much as we celebrate our own uniqueness, it is mediocrity that we have in common, novel, however, is the way one grasp their humanity.
          </p>

          <p><i>Kaleidoscope</i> explores this problem in a, admittedly ridiculous, creative context. A group of astronauts, shot in space, by an unwanted explosion on-board their space shuttle.
          God knows how they survive the initial explosion but, regardless, this left all the crew members drifting aimlessly through the vacuum of space. In their final moments, which they shared with each other
          through the fading, static voices of each other through their radios, they reflect on their own life choices and mortality.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Some are left hysterical at the cruel fate that lies ahead of them, others try to come to terms with it. Indeed, all man, no matter what life they led, has one thing in common, the very thing that unites us, we all will have to face our own end, one day.
            <br><br><q><i>When life is over it is like a flicker of
            bright film, an instant on the screen, all of its prejudices and passions condensed and illumined for an
            instant on space, and before you could cry out, “There was a happy day, there a bad one, there an evil
            face, there a good one,” the film burned to a cinder, the screen went dark.</i>
            </q>
          </p>

          <p>In the last hours, one may want find closure in the kind of life they lead, the joys, the ills, the remorse. I'd always of the conviction that one should consider their life after death as much as they do of their life before birth.
            Still, I find it hard to grasp my own mortality, <i>Kaleidoscope</i> tells us that we may find closure in our life choices, so we'd know that it wasn't all for nothing. Yet, for me, the fact remains, one's own mortality is hardly anything to celebrate, albeit morbid, it is true,
            how long will you be held in another's memory ? One generation ? Maybe two if you are lucky... And do those people even knew <i>you</i>, for one, you're a friend, for another, you're no more than another stranger that crossed path with them.
            We hold onto many things in life, it is a bondage we all chose, we let them dictate how 'good' our life be. Yet, know that what can be named are all external.
            <br>With all things external remember: <br>
            <ol>
              <li>We perceive an external thing or event.</li>
              <li>We form an “almost involuntary and seemingly unconscious value judgement” (in some instances) about that thing or event.</li>
              <li>An impression is a proposition, formed from a perception and the value judgement, that is presented to our guiding principle.</li>
              <li>We either assent to (agree with) the proposition or we reject it. We may also withhold judgement.</li>
            </ol>
