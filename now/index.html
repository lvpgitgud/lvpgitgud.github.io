            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>I've always been fascinated with the field of Computer Graphics, not long ago, I was first discovered OpenGL while developing one of my first game
            , since then I have dreamt of maintaining my own ad hoc renderer or game engine of some kind. The led me down a rabbit hole of learning more about graphics programming,
            the graphics pipeline and GPU/SIMD architecture. This project is an accumulation of my knowledge put to use.  
            </p>

            <h4>About Vulkan</h4>
            <p>OpenGL's <i>was</i> the leading graphics library, back then, the people behind OpenGL announced NextGl, the supposed successor of OpenGL, and now it is here and it's called Vulkan.
              <br>
              Vulkan can do anything OpenGL can and so much more.. at the cost of a high learning curve.
            </p>
            <p>One of the main appeal of Vulkan to me is its similiar syntax to OpenGL and <i>Raytracing hardware acceleration support</i>, which is a topic I wished to pursue in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <h4>Can't make an omlette without breaking eggs </h4>
            <p>In order for me to fully explore the potential of Vulkan, first I need to build a graphics pipeline using Vulkan, which is a task easier said than done.</p>
            <p>Luckily for me, the Kronos Group, the ones behind Vulkan, was graciously enough to provide a hands-on tutorial for their new API, which I highly <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html">recommend.</a></p>
